# Composer Hub

Elegantly Composer repository generator.

## About

Composer Hub is a tool build on top of Satis that allows PHP developers to create a private package repository for their projects' dependencies. It provides
increased control over package distribution, improved security, and faster package installations, by creating a static Composer
registry that can be hosted anywhere.
